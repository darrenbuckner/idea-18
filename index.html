            <div>
                <h3>Market Potential (Weight: 40%)</h3>
                <div>Score: 80</div>
                <p>There&#x27;s a significant and growing demand for tools that simplify subscription and user management, especially for small and mid-sized businesses that use Stripe. The market is sizable and growing, but the target market could be clearer.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Execution Feasibility (Weight: 30%)</h3>
                <div>Score: 85</div>
                <p>The technical complexity is moderate, as the service must reliably connect to Stripe, handle access control, and send SMS messages. Potential regulatory barriers related to data protection and privacy could exist. However, the time to market can be relatively short if no additional features are added.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Competitive Advantage (Weight: 30%)</h3>
                <div>Score: 75</div>
                <p>The unique value proposition is clear and strong: facilitating Stripe-related subscription management without the need for a database or complex auth flows. Barriers to entry are fairly high due to the technological expertise needed and potential partnerships with platforms like Stripe. There are existing competitors in the user authentication and subscription management sphere, but SubAuth&#x27;s focus on Stripe integration and SMS-based authentication is distinct.</p>
